      **Contents**

      Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of
      design and implementation decisions or decision about the development
      process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are
      valid for whole organizations and companies.

      **Motivation**

      Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design
      decisions and where they must adhere to constraints. Constraints must
      always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

      **Form**

      Simple tables of constraints with explanations. If needed you can
      subdivide them into technical constraints, organizational and political
      constraints and conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines,
      documentation or naming conventions)

      **Further Information**

      See [Architecture Constraints](https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/) in the
      arc42 documentation.
