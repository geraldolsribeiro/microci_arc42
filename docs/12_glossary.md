# 12. Glossary

[TBD]

!!! tldr inline end "Tips for completing this section"
      **Contents**

      The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

      You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in multi-language teams.

      **Motivation**

      You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

      * have an identical understanding of these terms
      * do not use synonyms and homonyms

      **Form**

      * A table with columns [TBD Term] and [TBD Definition].
      * Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

      **Further Information**

      See [Glossary](https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/) in the arc42 documentation.
